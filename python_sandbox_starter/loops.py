# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

#example
# Program to find the sum of all numbers stored in a list

# List of numbers
numbers = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11]

# variable to store the sum
sum = 0

# iterate over the list
for val in numbers:
	sum = sum+val

# Output: The sum is 48
print("The sum is", sum)



# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
